# hello_building_layout

- This flutter project was created following the instruction links: https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/layout/tutorial and https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/interactive.
- This is a simple app that shows picture and detail of an example of tourist attraction (Oeschinen Lake Campground) with interactivity on an icon (red star) tap/click.
- Apart from the instruction, I have tried separating codes from main.dart to separted widget files. And also add interactivity on call/route/share buttons as well.
